LanLearn Library:
Core library written in Kotlin. It's used to get from any text (plain text, pdf, epub, etc.) a list of words to learning.
E.g. user is polish native speaker and knows 3 english words : dog, cat, be. If library get to process a text: "Alicia has a dog and a pen",
output should be "dog - pies, pen - długopis, have - mieć". Word "Alicia" is omitted because it is a proper noun and a word "a" is omitted because
it is word without specific meaning.
